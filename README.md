# Number-Guessing-Game-with-Random-Numbers
C | Child processes, Time-based Seed, Standard I/O, User Input

This code is a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100, and then interacts with the user in a number guessing game. It repeatedly prompts the user to enter a number and provides feedback on whether the entered number is smaller ('<'), larger ('>'), or equal ('=') to the generated random number. The program uses the current time as a seed for random number generation to ensure randomness in each run. It also logs the feedback and the generated random number to the standard error stream. The program continues this interactive loop until the user guesses the correct number, at which point it prints "Child: done." to the standard error stream and terminates.
